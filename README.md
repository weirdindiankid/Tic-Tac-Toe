A simple game of Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses) for the iPhone

Works on iOS8, written in Swift.

Proposed changes:

1. Change the images to prettier looking ones.

2. Draw a line through the victory sequence when a user wins.

3. Change the New Game button functionality to make it more intuitive.

4. Fix the Auto Layout. (The bottom half of the board seems to disappear in landscape mode)

5. Add in artificial intelligence.

To Run:

Simply clone the repository and build it in XCode.

NB: This requires one of the newer versions of XCode. It will almost certainly fail if you try to run it on an outdated version
of XCode.
